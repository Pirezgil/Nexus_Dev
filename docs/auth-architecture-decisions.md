**Deciders:** System Architecture Team, Security Team

### Context

JWT tokens stored in browser storage are vulnerable to XSS attacks and can contain sensitive information in their payload.

### Decision

Encrypt all tokens before storage using the Web Crypto API with AES-GCM encryption. Each token is encrypted with a unique IV, and the encryption key is derived from browser characteristics.

### Rationale

- **Security:** Tokens are protected even if storage is compromised
- **Standards:** Uses browser-native, secure encryption
- **Performance:** Hardware-accelerated encryption
- **Privacy:** Token payloads are not readable in storage

### Consequences

**Positive:**

## ADR-006: Event-Driven Architecture for Authentication Events

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Deciders:** System Architecture Team

### Context

Authentication state changes need to be communicated to various parts of the application for proper UI updates and business logic execution.

### Decision

Implement an event-driven architecture using EventEmitter pattern with the following events:
- `auth:login`
- `auth:logout`
- `auth:refresh`
- `auth:error`
- `auth:stateChange`

### Rationale

- **Decoupling:** Separates authentication logic from UI components
- **Scalability:** Easy to add new event listeners
- **Debugging:** Clear event trail for troubleshooting
- **Flexibility:** Components can react to auth events independently

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Loose coupling between components
- Easy to add new authentication-dependent features
- Better separation of concerns

### Decision

Implement an exponential backoff retry strategy for authentication operations:
- Maximum 3 retry attempts
- Base delay of 1 second
- Exponential multiplier of 2
- Maximum delay of 10 seconds
- Only retry on network/temporary errors

### Rationale

When authentication fails, users are abruptly logged out without considering that they might be offline or experiencing temporary issues.

### Decision

Implement a progressive fallback strategy:
1. **Network Check:** Detect online/offline status
2. **Cached Operation:** Use cached data when offline
3. **Graceful Degradation:** Limit features instead of full logout
4. **Background Retry:** Attempt recovery when connection restored

### Rationale
