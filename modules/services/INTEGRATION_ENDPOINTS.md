## üîß Database Schema Changes

### Added Fields:
- **`appointments_completed.appointment_id`** - Links to original Agendamento appointment
- **Multi-schema support** with `@@schema("nexus_services")` attributes
- **Proper indexing** on `appointmentId` for performance

### Schema Structure:
```sql
-- appointments_completed table now includes:
appointment_id UUID, -- Reference to nexus_agendamento.appointments
-- With proper index:
@@index([appointmentId])
```

## üèóÔ∏è Integration Architecture

### Cross-Module Communication Flow:

1. **Agendamento ‚Üí Services:**
   - `GET /integrations/services/list` - List available services
   - `GET /integrations/professionals/list` - List available professionals  
   - `GET /integrations/professionals/:id/availability` - Check real-time availability

2. **Services ‚Üí CRM (Automatic):**
   - When appointment completes, Services automatically updates CRM with visit data
   - Creates customer note with service details

3. **Availability Calculation Logic:**
   - Reads professional's `workSchedule` JSON
   - Checks existing appointments from database
   - Generates available time slots based on service duration
   - Returns only genuinely available slots

## üìä Key Features Implemented:

### ‚úÖ **Professional Availability System**
- Real-time slot calculation
- Work schedule parsing
- Service duration consideration
- Conflict detection
- 30-minute caching for performance

### ‚úÖ **Appointment Completion Workflow**
- Links completed appointment to original booking
- Automatic CRM integration
- Payment status tracking
- Photo and notes storage
- Audit trail maintenance

### ‚úÖ **Multi-tenant Security**
- All endpoints require company authentication
- Data isolation by `companyId`
- Role-based access control
- Service-to-service authentication support

## üéØ Integration Validation

### Required Test Scenarios:
```bash
# 1. Agendamento can list services
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://nexus-services:5003/api/integrations/services/list

# 2. Agendamento can list professionals
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://nexus-services:5003/api/integrations/professionals/list

# 3. Check availability works
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://nexus-services:5003/api/integrations/professionals/prof-uuid/availability?date=2024-08-28&service_id=service-uuid"

# 4. Complete appointment works
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customer_id":"cust-uuid","professional_id":"prof-uuid","service_id":"serv-uuid","completed_at":"2024-08-28T10:00:00Z","payment_amount":150.00}' \
